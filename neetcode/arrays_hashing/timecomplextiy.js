/*
who why usualy if we are doing time complexity analaysis, and we iterate on array size n, we say the time complexity is O(n), if we do constant work for each array item?

because we just iterate on the array? and dont do nothing else?

but for espace complexity, we create array of size n elements, but inside it also the items length are effecting the result?


Time Complexity Question
You've raised an excellent point about the encode function's time complexity. Let me clarify:
Encode Time Complexity
The time complexity is indeed O(m) where m is the total length of all strings combined, not just O(n) where n is the number of strings. Here's why:

We do iterate through n strings, which would suggest O(n)
However, for each string, we also:

Need to calculate its length (proportional to string length)
Perform string concatenation operations



String concatenation is key here - when we do str += list[i].length + "#" + list[i], we're creating a new string that includes all previous characters plus the new ones. The work done is proportional to the total length of all strings processed so far.
While modern JavaScript engines optimize this, the time complexity analysis considers the operations performed on each character, which is why we express it as O(m).
Space Complexity Question
When analyzing array space complexity, we account for:

The structure of the array itself (references to n elements)
The actual content stored within the array (all m characters)

So yes, if you have:
javascriptCopy["extremelylongstring", "a", "b", "c"]
The space complexity includes:

The array overhead (storing 4 references)
The total content (all characters in all strings)

That's why O(m+n) is the correct expression - it accounts for both the number of strings and their combined length. If you had many tiny strings, both factors matter. If you had few large strings, the m would dominate, but we still count both components.
