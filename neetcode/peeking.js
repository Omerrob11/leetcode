1. at least brute force solution
2. do not look before brute force


Two things that I do when studying leetcode - When I get stuck with no progress for 20-30 minutes I look at the solution, then try to implement the solution without just copying it to enforce that I actually understand it. I then write the problem down and come back to it one or two times in the next couple weeks, especially if the solution looks like there is something I can learn and reuse in similar problems.

Other than that try to focus on one subject at a time for a few problems to strengthen similar strategies through repetition.



Give each problem atleast 15 mins before reading the solution. Think about it from every angle and you could solve it. In my case, I found discussing problem with my friend/flatmate more helpful than looking at the solution.

Personally, If I am working on a particular topic, I learn about the subject using a course or a book and then start solving problems related to it, not looking at solutions.
For example, for the first few dynamic programming problems I solved, I spent sometimes 2 to 3 hours to really understand a problem, solve it on paper, code the solution and then optimizing the solution. And when I was stuck, I tried rereading about the subject from a different source to really understand the concepts. I avoided looking at solutions because it would not really teach me how to solve these problem but rather just show the end result without the steps to solve the problems.

If I am solving random questions, I would personally try to solve a problem for 20 minutes without hints. Usually I write all my ideas on a piece of paper and try to code what I think is the best idea in this amount of time. If I did not find a good solution to the problem in 30 minutes, I look at the hints. Then, if I still did not find a solution, I look at the related topics, it usually gives a lot of information on the question. And finally, I look at solutions if the hints did not help me. I do not spend too much time solving a random question because sometimes I get questions about topics I did not study yet.
